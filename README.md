Website for the portfolio of coding projects

## Main Idea
The main idea of this project is to have a star system that represents each and every coding project I've worked on so far, having it be interactive with the user
when they hover over a planet and click it, the camera should zoom in on the planet and follow it in its orbit while also displaying more information about the 
coding project the planet is associated with.

### First Iteration
So far, I've used the Threejs module to create a 3-dimensional environment where there is a basic star system. The orbits are handled currently by assigning the coordinates
of each planet according to trigonometric function outputs to determine their location. They have a solid color texture currently but I hope to create variance in the
generation of planet terrain and more through code in the near future.
